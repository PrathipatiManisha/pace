1:  write a program to print 1-10 numbers using while loop
2: write a program to print even numbers using while loop
3: write a program to print odd numbers using while loop
4: write a program to print 1,4,9,16,25…100  using while loop
5: write a program to print 10, 9, 8, 7….1 using while loop
Sum of First 5 numbers
sum=0;
   \0
sum=sum+1-------0+1=1
    \1
sum=sum+2-------1+2=3
    \3
sum=sum+3-------3+3=6
    \6
sum=sum+4-------6+4=10
    \10
sum=sum+5-------10+5=15(print)

6: write a program to calculate 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 using while loop
7: write a program to print 1,2,3,4,……n  using while loop
8: write a program to print n,n-1,n-2,n-3,….1. using while loop
9: write a program to read a number and print mathematical table for that particular number.
=====================================================
10: write a program to read a number and count the number of digits
	Exclude the remainder(for each division)
	count the no of times the loop is executed
11: write a program to read a number and print sum of digits
	Extract each digit from the number(nothing but remainder)
	Add each digit
12: write a program to print reverse of the given number
	Extract last digit---- each position is 10multiple
	While shifting to next position, multiply value with 10 and add the remainder
13: write a program to check the given number is palindrom or not.
	Store the number in temporary variable
Perform operation same as reverse Number
Compare temporary variable with the reverse number
14: write a program to check the given number is Armstrong or not.
         Sum of power of the individual digits(Armstrong Number), 153: 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3=153
	Need to find number of digits first, perform power on number of digits times
	Add every power of the digit, compare with the initial given value
	Perform no of digits and store the count in count var
	while(n!=0){
	int res=1;
	rem = n%10;
		for(i=1; i<=count; i++){
		  res=res*rem;
		}
		  n=n/10;
		  sum = sum+res;
	}
15: write a program to read a number and convert decimal to binary.
16: write a program to check the given number is prime or not


For
1: write a program to check given number perfect or not.
2: write a program to print the febonacci series.
